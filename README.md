# **ComPass - Navigate Your Company**\
As part of a project for the course "Mobile Device Application Development", 
we created a mobile application called "ComPass". Many businesses often face 
the problem of managing leave requests in the workplace, frequently due to a 
large number of employees and difficulty in communicating with the person responsible 
for handling leave requests. 
ComPass aims to help employees and employers communicate 
more easily and asynchronously regarding this issue. Specifically, the application allows 
employees to request leave from work. This request is then transferred through the app to 
the responsible person, who can either approve or reject the request.

The typical users of the application are three:
* Employer of a company
* Head of leave management
* Employee

**Functionality**\
The features of ComPass are as follows:

The Employer of a Company:
* During account creation, the employer enters information about the departments that make up the company, among other details. Additional departments can be added later as well.
* The employer has access to a list of all departments, including the head and employees of each department.

The Leave Manager of a Department:
* During account creation, the manager selects the department of the company they work for.
* The manager can handle (accept/reject) leave requests from the employees of their department.
* The manager can view which employees are currently on leave and for how long. A calendar is provided to make it easier to view the days directly.
* The manager can see which employees are working in their department.

An Employee of a Company:
* During account creation, the employee selects the department of the company they work for.
* Using the calendar, the employee can create a leave request by selecting the date and the reason for the leave (parental, sick leave, etc.).
* If the employee selects sick leave, they must attach a file with the doctor's note.
* The employee can view the status of their leave request (pending/accepted/rejected/no requests) in their profile.

Every User:
* When creating an account, each user selects their role type (employer/head/employee).
* Each user has a profile with basic information about themselves.
* Users can modify some of the details they provided during registration.
* Users can log out and log back in at any time.
